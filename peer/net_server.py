Simple Single Threaded Server

This program defines the simple server class variable and calls the server into
operation.

The server simulates an action with a fixed service time. The fixed
service time is an experimental variable: service_time. Other key variables are
the socket address which this service binds to.

Program execution follows a single thread for every client-server session. The
server receives a simple text message from the client, performs an action and
replies with a simple text response. Upon receipt of the end message ('bye'),
the server shuts itself down.
